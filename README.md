## Description

As a web developer with a passion for making art I wanted to make a prototype art store for myself. This project is designed to push my developement skills by building a fully functioning e-commerce site single. I also wanted to create it so that if I ever decided to sell my art I would already have a site ready to go. I am already expanding my knowledge of React, GraphQL and other front-end frameworks such as MUI while working on this project. I have also needed to think outside the box in order to solve problems I have never experienced before.

The Production verison of this application can be found at https://chrisvergesart-a007f39ad1a3.herokuapp.com/
