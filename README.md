  ## Description
  As a web developer with a passion for making art I wanted to make a prototype art store for myself. This project is designed to push my developement skills by building a fully functioning e-commerce site single handedly but also so that if I ever decided to sell my art I would already have a site ready to go. I am already expanding my knowledge of React, GraphQL and other front-end frameworks such as MUI while working on this project and am excited to continue to push myself.
